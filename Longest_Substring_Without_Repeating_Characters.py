        Brute force could be trying every possible substring, checking if it has all   
        unique characters, and keeping track of the max length. But that would be O(nÂ²).
        Let's visualise it anyways.
        
        n = len(s)
        max_length = 0

        for i in range(n):
            seen_chars = set()
            for j in range(i, n):
                if s[j] in seen_chars:
                    break
                seen_chars.add(s[j])
                max_length = max(max_length, j - i + 1)

        return max_length
        
        Now, putting in sliding window concept ->
        Basically, what we can do is take 2 pointers i and j again to maintain a window 
        of a substring that has unique characters. We'll then keep moving the j pointer 
        rightwards to add more characters. If a duplicate is detected, we just need to 
        shrink the window from left by moving the i pointer rightwards until the 
        duplicate is removed.
